            About Islam
        </h1>
        <p>
            Islam is religion centred primarily around the Quran, <br>

            a religious text considered by Muslims to be the direct word of God or Allah as it was revealed to
            Muhammad PBUH, <br>

            the main and final Islamic prophet. <br>

            is the world's second-largest religion behind Christianity,with its followers ranging between 1-1.8
            billion globally, <br>

            or around a quarter of the world's population. <br>

            Islam teaches that God is merciful, <br>

            all-powerful,and unique, <br>

            and has guided humanity through various prophets,revealed scriptures, and natural signs, <br>

            with the Quran serving as the final and universal revelation and Muhammad serving as the "Seal of the
            Prophets"the last prophet of God. <br>

            The teachings and practices of Muhammad sunnah documented in traditional collected accountshadith
            provide a secondary constitution
            al model for Muslims to follow after the Quran. <br>

            Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed
            many times through earlier prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, <br>

            among others; <br>

            these earlier revelations are attributed to Judaism and Christianity, <br>

            which are regarded in Islam as spiritual predecessor faiths. <br>

            They also consider the Quran, <br>

            when preserved in Classical Arabic, <br>

            to be the unaltered and final revelation of God to humanity. <br>

            Like other Abrahamic religions, <br>

            Islam also teaches of a "Final Judgement" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise Jannah and
            the unrighteous will be punished in hell Jahannam. <br>

            Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam—considered obligatory acts of
            worship—and following Islamic law, <br>

            which touches on virtually every aspect of life, <br>

            from banking and finance and welfare to women's roles and the environment. <br>

            The cities of Mecca, <br>

            Medina, and Palestine are home to the three holiest sites in Islam, <br>

            in descending order:Masjid al-Haram, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, and Al-Aqsa Mosque, respectively. <br>

            Islam originated in the 7th century at Jabal al-Nour, <br>

            a mountain peak near Mecca where Muhammad's first revelation is said to have taken place. <br>

            Through various caliphates, <br>

            the religion later spread outside of Arabia shortly after Muhammad's death,and by the 8th century, <br>

            the Umayyad Caliphate had imposed Islamic rule from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus
            Valley in the east. <br>

            The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th
            century, <br>

            during the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate, <br>

            when much of the Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, <br>

            economic, <br>

            and cultural flourishing. <br>

            The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and
            religious conversion as a result of
            Islamic missionary activities dawah.

            <p>Islam is a religion that originated in the Middle East in the 7th century. <br>

                It is based on the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, who is believed by Muslims to be the final prophet
                sent by God to deliver His message to humanity. <br>

                The central text of Islam is the Quran, which is believed to be the word of God as revealed to Muhammad
                through the angel Gabriel. <br>

                In addition to the Quran, <br>

                Muslims also follow the Hadith, <br>

                which are collections of sayings and actions of Muhammad that provide guidance on how to live a good and
                righteous life. <br>

                Islam is a monotheistic religion, meaning that Muslims believe in one God, <br>

                Allah. <br>

                Muslims believe that God is all-powerful and all-knowing, <br>

                and that He is the creator of the universe. <br>

                They believe that God has revealed His will and guidance to humanity through a series of prophets, <br>

                including Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and that Muhammad is the final prophet. <br>

                Islam teaches that the purpose of life is to worship God and to follow His commands. <br>

                This involves living a life of submission to God and seeking to do good deeds. <br>

                Muslims are expected to follow the Five Pillars of Islam, <br>

                which are the shahadah (declaration of faith), salat (daily prayers), zakat (charity), sawm (fasting
                during the month of Ramadan), and hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). <br>

                In addition to these practices, <br>

                Islam also emphasizes the importance of charity and helping those in need. <br>

                Muslims are expected to give a portion of their income to the poor and to participate in acts of charity
                and social welfare. <br>

                Islam also teaches the belief in an afterlife, <br>

                and that on the Day of Judgment, <br>

                all people will be held accountable for their actions in this life. <br>

                Those who have lived a good and righteous life will be rewarded with paradise, <br>

                while those who have lived a wicked life will be punished. <br>

                Overall, Islam is a religion that promotes peace, justice, and compassion, <br>

                and encourages its followers to lead a life of devotion to God and service to others. <br>
