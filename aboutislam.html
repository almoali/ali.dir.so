        About Islam.
    </h1>
    <p class="AboutIslam">
        Islam is religion centred primarily around the Quran,

        a religious text considered by Muslims to be the direct word of God or Allah as it was revealed to
        Muhammad PBUH,

        the main and final Islamic prophet. <br><br>

        is the world's second-largest religion behind Christianity,with its followers exceeding 2
        billion globally, <br>

        or around a quarter of the world's population. <br><br>

        Islam teaches that God is merciful, <br>

        all-powerful,and unique, <br>

        and has guided humanity through various prophets,revealed scriptures, and natural signs, <br>

        with the Quran serving as the final and universal revelation and Muhammad serving as the "Seal of the
        Prophets"the last prophet of God. <br><br>

        The teachings and practices of Muhammad sunnah documented in traditional collected accounts hadith
        provide a secondary constitution
        al model for Muslims to follow after the Quran. <br><br>

        Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed
        many times through earlier prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, <br>

        among others; <br>

        these earlier revelations are attributed to Judaism and Christianity, <br>

        which are regarded in Islam as spiritual predecessor faiths. <br><br>

        They also consider the Quran, <br>

        when preserved in Classical Arabic, <br>

        to be the unaltered and final revelation of God to humanity. <br><br>

        Like other Abrahamic religions, <br>

        Islam also teaches of a "Final Judgement" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise Jannah and
        the unrighteous will be punished in hell Jahannam. <br><br>

        Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam—considered obligatory acts of
        worship—and following Islamic law, <br>

        which touches on virtually every aspect of life, <br>

        from banking and finance and welfare to women's roles and the environment. <br>

        The cities of Mecca, <br>

        Medina, and Palestine are home to the three holiest sites in Islam, <br>

        in descending order:Masjid al-Haram, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, and Al-Aqsa Mosque, respectively. <br>

        Islam originated in the 7th century at Jabal al-Nour, <br>

        a mountain peak near Mecca where Muhammad's first revelation is said to have taken place. <br>

        Through various caliphates, <br>

        the religion later spread outside of Arabia shortly after Muhammad's death,and by the 8th century, <br>

        the Umayyad Caliphate had imposed Islamic rule from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus
        Valley in the east. <br><br>

        The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th
        century, <br>

        during the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate, <br>

        when much of the Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, <br>

        economic, <br>

        and cultural flourishing. <br><br>

        The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and
        religious conversion as a result of
        Islamic missionary activities dawah.<br><br>



        Islam is a religion that originated in the Middle East in the 7th century. <br><br>

        It is based on the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, who is believed by Muslims to be the final prophet
        sent by God to deliver His message to humanity. <br><br>

        The central text of Islam is the Quran, which is believed to be the word of God as revealed to Muhammad
        through the angel Gabriel. <br><br>

        In addition to the Quran, <br>

        Muslims also follow the Hadith, <br>

        which are collections of sayings and actions of Muhammad that provide guidance on how to live a good and
        righteous life. <br><br>

        Islam is a monotheistic religion, meaning that Muslims believe in one God, <br>

        Allah. <br><br>

        Muslims believe that God is all-powerful and all-knowing, <br>

        and that He is the creator of the universe. <br><br>

        They believe that God has revealed His will and guidance to humanity through a series of prophets, <br>

        including Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and that Muhammad is the final prophet. <br><br>

        Islam teaches that the purpose of life is to worship God and to follow His commands. <br><br>

        This involves living a life of submission to God and seeking to do good deeds. <br><br>

        Muslims are expected to follow the Five Pillars of Islam, <br>

        which are the shahadah (declaration of faith), salat (daily prayers), zakat (charity), sawm (fasting
        during the month of Ramadan), and hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). <br><br>

        In addition to these practices, <br>

        Islam also emphasizes the importance of charity and helping those in need. <br><br>

        Muslims are expected to give a portion of their income to the poor and to participate in acts of charity
        and social welfare. <br><br>

        Islam also teaches the belief in an afterlife, <br>

        and that on the Day of Judgment, <br>

        all people will be held accountable for their actions in this life. <br><br>

        Those who have lived a good and righteous life will be rewarded with paradise, <br>

        while those who have lived a wicked life will be punished. <br><br>

        Overall, Islam is a religion that promotes peace, justice, and compassion, <br>

        and encourages its followers to lead a life of devotion to God and service to others. <br><br>
