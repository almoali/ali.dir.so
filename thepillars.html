    </h1>
    <p class="pill">The Five Pillars of Islam are the five obligations that are mandatory for all Muslims:
<br>
        <strong>Shahadah:</strong> Profession of faith. This involves reciting the Islamic creed, "There is no god but God,
        and Muhammad is the messenger of God."<br>
        <strong> Daily prayers.</strong> Muslims are required to pray five times a day facing the Kaaba in Mecca.<br>
        <strong>Zakat: </strong>Charitable giving. Muslims are required to give a portion of their income to the poor and
        needy.<br>
        <strong>Sawm:</strong> Fasting during the month of Ramadan. Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset during this time.<br>
        <strong>Hajj:</strong> Pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims are required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in
        their lifetime if they are physically and financially able.</p>

    <h2 class="isimih2">This is an hadith about Islam, Iman and Ihsan </h2>
    <p class="isimih">
        <strong> was narrated on the authority of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: <br>

        While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before
        us a <br>
        man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were
        visible on <br>
        him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet (peace be upon him), rested his knee
        against <br>
        his thighs, and said, "O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam." <br>

        The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is that you should testify that there is no
        deity <br>
        except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast
        during <br>
        Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so." <br>

        The man said, "You have spoken truly." We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and
        telling <br>
        him that he was right, but he went on to say, "Inform me about iman." <br>

        He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books
        and His <br>
        Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects." He
        said, <br>
        "You have spoken truly." <br>

        Then he (the man) said, "Inform me about Ihsan." He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that
        you <br>
        should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He
        sees you." <br>

        He said, "Inform me about the Hour." He (the Messenger of Allah) said, "About that, the one
        questioned knows <br>
        no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about the signs thereof." He said, "They
        are that <br>
        the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute,
        the <br>
        herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man
        went of. I <br>
        waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O Umar, do you know who that questioner
        was?" I <br>
        replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better." He said, "That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He
        came to <br>
        teach you your religion." <br></strong>
