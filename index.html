                    href="#islamic-iman">IMAN PILLARS,</a></p>
            <p>Islam is religion centred primarily around the Quran, <br>

                a religious text considered by Muslims to be the direct word of God or Allah as it was revealed to
                Muhammad PBUH, <br>

                the main and final Islamic prophet. <br>

                is the world's second-largest religion behind Christianity,with its followers ranging between 1-1.8
                billion globally, <br>

                or around a quarter of the world's population. <br>

                Islam teaches that God is merciful, <br>

                all-powerful,and unique, <br>

                and has guided humanity through various prophets,revealed scriptures, and natural signs, <br>

                with the Quran serving as the final and universal revelation and Muhammad serving as the "Seal of the
                Prophets"the last prophet of God. <br>

                The teachings and practices of Muhammad sunnah documented in traditional collected accountshadith
                provide a secondary constitution
                al model for Muslims to follow after the Quran. <br>

                Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed
                many times through earlier prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, <br>

                among others; <br>

                these earlier revelations are attributed to Judaism and Christianity, <br>

                which are regarded in Islam as spiritual predecessor faiths. <br>

                They also consider the Quran, <br>

                when preserved in Classical Arabic, <br>

                to be the unaltered and final revelation of God to humanity. <br>

                Like other Abrahamic religions, <br>

                Islam also teaches of a "Final Judgement" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise Jannah and
                the unrighteous will be punished in hell Jahannam. <br>

                Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam—considered obligatory acts of
                worship—and following Islamic law, <br>

                which touches on virtually every aspect of life, <br>

                from banking and finance and welfare to women's roles and the environment. <br>

                The cities of Mecca, <br>

                Medina, and Palestine are home to the three holiest sites in Islam, <br>

                in descending order:Masjid al-Haram, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, and Al-Aqsa Mosque, respectively. <br>

                Islam originated in the 7th century at Jabal al-Nour, <br>

                a mountain peak near Mecca where Muhammad's first revelation is said to have taken place. <br>

                Through various caliphates, <br>

                the religion later spread outside of Arabia shortly after Muhammad's death,and by the 8th century, <br>

                the Umayyad Caliphate had imposed Islamic rule from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus
                Valley in the east. <br>

                The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th
                century, <br>

                during the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate, <br>

                when much of the Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, <br>

                economic, <br>

                and cultural flourishing. <br>

                The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and
                religious conversion as a result of
                Islamic missionary activities dawah.</p>

            <p class="islamic-info">Islam is a religion that originated in the Middle East in the 7th century. <br>

                It is based on the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, who is believed by Muslims to be the final prophet
                sent by God to deliver His message to humanity. <br>

                The central text of Islam is the Quran, which is believed to be the word of God as revealed to Muhammad
                through the angel Gabriel. <br>

                In addition to the Quran, <br>

                Muslims also follow the Hadith, <br>

                which are collections of sayings and actions of Muhammad that provide guidance on how to live a good and
                righteous life. <br>

                Islam is a monotheistic religion, meaning that Muslims believe in one God, <br>

                Allah. <br>

                Muslims believe that God is all-powerful and all-knowing, <br>

                and that He is the creator of the universe. <br>

                They believe that God has revealed His will and guidance to humanity through a series of prophets, <br>

                including Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and that Muhammad is the final prophet. <br>

                Islam teaches that the purpose of life is to worship God and to follow His commands. <br>

                This involves living a life of submission to God and seeking to do good deeds. <br>

                Muslims are expected to follow the Five Pillars of Islam, <br>

                which are the shahadah (declaration of faith), salat (daily prayers), zakat (charity), sawm (fasting
                during the month of Ramadan), and hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). <br>

                In addition to these practices, <br>

                Islam also emphasizes the importance of charity and helping those in need. <br>

                Muslims are expected to give a portion of their income to the poor and to participate in acts of charity
                and social welfare. <br>

                Islam also teaches the belief in an afterlife, <br>

                and that on the Day of Judgment, <br>

                all people will be held accountable for their actions in this life. <br>

                Those who have lived a good and righteous life will be rewarded with paradise, <br>

                while those who have lived a wicked life will be punished. <br>

                Overall, Islam is a religion that promotes peace, justice, and compassion, <br>

                and encourages its followers to lead a life of devotion to God and service to others. <br>

                <!--AN HADITH ABOUT IMAN-->
                <h2>This is an hadith about IMAN</h2>
                <p>
                    It was narrated on the authority of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: <br>

                    While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before
                    us a <br>
                    man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were
                    visible on <br>
                    him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet (peace be upon him), rested his knee
                    against <br>
                    his thighs, and said, "O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam." <br>

                    The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is that you should testify that there is no
                    deity <br>
                    except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast
                    during <br>
                    Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so." <br>

                    The man said, "You have spoken truly." We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and
                    telling <br>
                    him that he was right, but he went on to say, "Inform me about iman." <br>

                    He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books
                    and His <br>
                    Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects." He
                    said, <br>
                    "You have spoken truly." <br>

                    Then he (the man) said, "Inform me about Ihsan." He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, "It is that
                    you <br>
                    should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He
                    sees you." <br>

                    He said, "Inform me about the Hour." He (the Messenger of Allah) said, "About that, the one
                    questioned knows <br>
                    no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about the signs thereof." He said, "They
                    are that <br>
                    the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute,
                    the <br>
                    herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man
                    went of. I <br>
                    waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O Umar, do you know who that questioner
                    was?" I <br>
                    replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better." He said, "That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He
                    came to <br>
                    teach you your religion." <br>
