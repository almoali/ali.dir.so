    <h1>Quran Translation Of audio 1 aka "Surah Maryam"></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Kãf-Ha-Ya-’Aĩn- Ṣãd.</li>
        <li>˹This is˺ a reminder of your Lord’s mercy to His servant Zachariah,</li>
        <li>when he cried out to his Lord privately,</li>
        <li>saying, <br>
            “My Lord! <br>
            Surely my bones have become brittle, <br>
            and grey hair has spread across my head, <br>
            but I have never been disappointed in my prayer to You <br>
            , my Lord!</li>
        <li>And I am concerned about ˹the faith of˺ my relatives after me, <br>
            since my wife is barren. <br>
            So grant me, <br>
            by Your grace, an heir,</li>
        <li>who will inherit ˹prophethood˺ <br>
            from me and the family of Jacob, <br>
            and make him, <br>
            O Lord, pleasing ˹to You˺!” <br>
        </li>
        <li>˹The angels announced, <br>
            ˺ “O Zachariah! <br>
            Indeed, We give you the good news of ˹the birth of˺ a son, <br>
            whose name will be John—a name We have not given to anyone before.”</li>
        <li>He wondered, <br>
            “My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren, <br>
            and I have become extremely old?”</li>
        <li>An angel replied, <br>
            “So will it be! Your Lord says, <br>
            ‘It is easy for Me, <br>
            just as I created you before, <br>
            when you were nothing!’”</li>
        <li>Zachariah said, <br>
            “My Lord! Grant me a sign.” <br>
            He responded, <br>
            “Your sign is that you will not ˹be able to˺ speak to people for three nights, <br>
            despite being healthy.” <br>
        </li>
        <li>So he came out to his people from the sanctuary, <br>
            signalling to them to glorify ˹Allah˺ morning and evening.</li>
        <li>˹It was later said, <br>
            ˺ “O John! Hold firmly to the Scriptures. <br>
            ” And We granted him wisdom while ˹he was still˺ a child, <br>
        </li>
        <li>as well as purity and compassion from Us. And he was God-fearing, <br>
        </li>
        <li>and kind to his parents.
            He was neither arrogant nor disobedient. <br>
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h1>Quran Translation Of audio 2 aka "Surah An-Naml"></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>And,
            although their hearts were convinced the signs were true,
            they still denied them wrongfully and arrogantly.
            See then what was the end of the corruptors!</li>
        <li>Indeed, We granted knowledge to David and Solomon.
            And they said ˹in acknowledgment˺,
            “All praise is for Allah Who has privileged us over many of His faithful servants.”</li>
        <li>And David was succeeded by Solomon,
            who said,
            “O people! We have been taught the language of birds,
            and been given everything ˹we need˺.
            This is indeed a great privilege.”</li>
        <li>Solomon’s forces of jinn,
            humans,
            and birds were rallied for him,
            perfectly organized.</li>
        <li>And when they came across a valley of ants,
            an ant warned,
            “O ants! Go quickly into your homes so Solomon and his armies do not crush you,
            unknowingly.”</li>
        <li>So Solomon smiled in amusement at her words,
            and prayed,
            “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺
            be thankful for Your favours which You have blessed me
            and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please you.
            Admit me,
            by Your mercy,
            into ˹the company of˺ Your righteous servants.”</li>
        <li>˹One day˺ he inspected the birds,
            and wondered,
            “Why is it that I cannot see the hoopoe?
            Or could he be absent?</li>
        <li>I will surely subject him to a severe punishment,
            or ˹even˺ slaughter him,
            unless he brings me a compelling excuse.”</li>
        <li>It was not long before the bird came and said,
            “I have found out something you do not know.
            I have just come to you from Sheba with sure news.</li>
    </ol>
